"Unless you are participating in a workshop, the device comes unassembled."
" There are three parts: the printed circuit board with the buttons and "
"the electronics, the display, and the battery holder. To assemble it you "
"will need a soldering iron, wire cutters, solder and two-sided tape. You "
"will also need two AAA 1.5V batteries, a micro-USB cable and a computer "
"with a working USB port."

"You start the assembly by attaching and soldering the display. Insert the"
" provided LED matrix into the 16 holes in the middle of the printed "
"circuit board, making sure that the side of the matrix with text on it "
"faces right, towards the two fire buttons. You may need to straighten the"
" pins a little if they bent during the transport."

"Once the matrix is inserted, flip the device up-side-down, make sure that"
" the display aligns flush with the sides (there is a little wiggle room),"
" and solder each of the pins. To do that, touch the tip of a hot "
"soldering iron to the pin and the ring around the hole at the same time, "
"wait a second for them to become hot, and then touch them with the solder"
" wire, melting enough solder to fill the hole."

"The next step is connecting and attaching the battery holder. First, make"
" sure that the wires of the battery holder go through the holes in the "
"plastic that are furthest apart. If they go through the holes that are "
"close together, you will need to move them back, and thread them through "
"the correct holes. Once you have done that, cut both wires to about 1cm "
"length and remove the insulation from them with the wire cutters (please "
"don't use your teeth). Twist the strands of each of the wire, so that "
"they are easier to move through the holes in the circuit board. Next, "
"place two-sided tape on the battery holder, and attach it to the circuit "
"board so that the two wires go through the holes marked + and - (make "
"sure the red wire goes to +, and the black one to -). There are two sets "
"of such holes, pick the correct one depending on what order the wires "
"come out of your battery holder."

"It is very important to pay attention to the battery polarity, as this "
"device doesn't have any kind of reverse polarity protection, and "
"coonnecting the batteries in reverse will damage it."

"Flip the device to the top side, and use the soldering iron to solder the"
" two wires sticking out of the holes in the circuit board. Be careful to "
"not touch the plastic of the buttons with your iron, as it will melt. "
"Finally, cut the excess wires with your wire cutters. Your device is "
"ready."
