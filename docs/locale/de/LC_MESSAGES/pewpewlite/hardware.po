"PewPew Lite is a shield for the Adafruit Feather series of development "
"boards (a FeatherWing, as they call them). You put it on top of one of "
"their boards, and then program that board (preferably in CircuitPython) "

"The shield contains six buttons and an eight-by-eight bi-color LED "
"display, capable of displaying four different colors (black, green, red "
"and yellow). It also includes a HT16K33 chip that handles the display and"
" the buttons, so that you can focus on just writing the code for your "
"game. Optionally, you can add a LiPO battery to it, to make the whole "
"thing into a portable handheld game console. The shield includes a power "
"switch for that battery."
