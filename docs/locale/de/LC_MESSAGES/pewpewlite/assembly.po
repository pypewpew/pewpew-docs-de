"The PewPew FeatherWing comes without the pin headers and LED matrix "
"attached, so that some simple soldering is required before using it."

"The simplest way to assemble the PewPew board is to use an `Adafruit "
"Feather <https://www.adafruit.com/category/946>`_ board that supports "
"CircuitPython (the `Feather M0 Express "
"<https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403>`_ works great for this) with "
"female pin headers, and to solder the male pin headers onto the PewPew "
"FeatherWing. Afterwards, insert the LED Matrix into place, solder its "
"pins from the bottom, and trim them with wire cutters."

"Make sure to insert the LED Matrix in correct orientation -- with the "
"markings in the same direction as the \"down\" button. Otherwise the "
"colors will be wrong, and the image will be flipped."
msgstr ""

#: ../../pewpewlite/assembly.rst:25

"Note that you should solder the pin headers first, and then solder the "
"LED matrix. Trying to do it in the opposite order may lead to damaging "
"the matrix with your soldering iron."

"The basic assembly is fine, but it's good 2cm thick. You can make the "
"whole thing much thinner by applying a number of tricks. First, use the "
"`short female pin headers <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2940>`_ for "
"the Adafruit Feather. Second, move the plastic on your male pin headers "
"to the end of the header, insert the header from the top, and try it with"
" the Feather to see how long the pins need to be. Then solder them, and "
"trim the parts sticking out from the top with wire cutters. This way the "
"PewPew FeatherWing can sit right on top of the battery plug of the "
"Feather."

#: ../../pewpewlite/assembly.rst:50
msgid ""
"To make the PewPew even more portable, you can add a small LiPO battery "
"(`the 100mAh batteries <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1570>`_ are "
"about the right size). The FeatherWing even has a power switch built-in "
"that you can use. Just solder the battery leads to the two holes marked "
"\"+\" for the red wire, and \"-\" for the black wire. Be very careful to "
"not short the battery wires while you are doing that. Then you can use "
"two-sided tape to stick the battery on the underside of the FeatherWing, "
"sandwiching it between the two boards. You may need to add some electric "
"tape to prevent the metal body of the battery from shorting things on the"
" boards."

"All the example programs are written using CircuitPython, so you will "
"need to get that running on your Feather board. Fortunately Adafruit "
"provides a lot of tutorials about how to do it. Some of the boards (like "
"the M0 Express) even come with CircuitPython already loaded on them. "
"Please see `this guide <https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-"
"circuitpython/installing-circuitpython>`_."

"Once you have CircuitPython running on the board, you need to copy the "
"``pew.mpy`` file to it. That's the main library that contains all the "
"functions needed to use the PewPew hardware."

"In addition, you need to copy your program onto the board. You have to "
"name it ``main.py`` for it to be started automatically on power-up. Later"
" on we will see how we can use a menu program that will let you choose "
"what to run (you have to rename the ``menu.py`` to ``main.py`` to have it"
" run at start)."
